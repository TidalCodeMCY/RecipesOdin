    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter or cream cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup pork rind crumbs Pork Rind Crumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg </li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon Redmond Real salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If you have a pizza stone, place it into the oven. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
        <li>To make the dough, place the mozzarella and the butter in a heat safe bowl and microwave for 1-2 minutes or until the cheese is entirely melted. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Add the powered pork rinds, egg and salt and using a hand mixer, combine well.</li>
        <li>Put the dough on the greased piece of parchment paper on a flat baking sheet and pat out with your hands to make a large round circle.</li>
        <li>If you are using a pizza stone, transfer the pizza on the parchment and slide it onto to the hot pizza stone in the oven by sliding the parchment and pizza from the baking sheet onto the stone. Bake for 5 minutes or until the crust starts to get a little golden.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven. Spread pizza sauce all over the top of the crust and mozzarella cheese and your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza until the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Store extras in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat slices on a baking sheet in a preheated 350Â°F oven for 5 minutes or until warmed through.</li>
    </ol>
