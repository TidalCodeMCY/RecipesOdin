    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>In a heavy pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, half of the ground meat, and the Italian sausage. Brown for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the meat mixture, if needed. Add the tomato sauce, brown sugar, 1 tablespoon parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon each of the fennel seed, basil, thyme, oregano, black pepper and salt. Gently stir, cover, and let simmer over low heat for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is cooking, prepare the meatballs, ricotta cheese mixture, and lasagna noodles. First, beat 1 egg in a large bowl. Add the oatmeal, 1/2 cup of Parmasan, and the rest of the ground meat, black pepper, fennel seed, basil, thyme, oregano, and salt. Combine well.</li>
        <li>Roll the meat into balls that are about 1 inch in diameter. Place them on a sprayed pan and bake for 20 minutes, turning the meatballs over halfway through the cooking time.</li>
        <li>Put the ricotta cheese in another bowl. Add the other egg, nutmeg, and rest of parsley. Combine well and set aside.</li>
        <li>Now just soak the lasagna noodles in a large pan filled with very hot water for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce is cooked, construct the lasagna in a deep 9x3-inch pan. First, spread 2 cups of the sauce on the bottom of the pan. Lay 6 noodles down. Spread half of the ricotta over the noodles, then sprinkle that with 1/3 of the mozzeralla and parmasan. Top that with half of the pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Make another layer in the same way, starting with 2 cups of sauce. After that, lay down the rest of the lasagna noodles on top.</li>
        <li>Mix in the cooked meatballs with the rest of the sauce, and spread on top of the lasagna. Top with rest of cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil, and bake at 350F for 25 minutes. Remove the foil, then bake for 25 minutes. Remove, then let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
